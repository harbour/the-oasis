  <CENTER><H2>THE OASIS PRIVACY POLICY</H2></CENTER>

  The Oasis has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our
  firm commitment to our visitors' and participants' privacy. The following
  discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this
  Web site: www.the-oasis.net. This Privacy Policy is a portion of, and is
  incorporated into, the Web Site Terms and Conditions of Use.

  <H3>Non-Personal Information </H3> During your visit to the Site, we may
  request non-personally identifiable demographic and profile data, though
  your provision of this information is optional. We may use this data to
  improve our Site and enhance your experience. For example, we may use this
  data to tailor your experience at our Site, show you content that we think
  you might be interested in, and display content according to your
  preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as
  advertisers interested in advertising on The Oasis Site, in aggregate,
  anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any
  personally identifiable information about you or any other person.

<P>We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server,
  and to administer our Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you
  for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic information.

<P>As you browse the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at
  each Web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes called
  "clickstream" data, can be collected and stored by a Web site's server.
  Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you
  use, the address of the Web site from which you linked to The Oasis Site,
  and in some instances, your e-mail address. We may use clickstream data to
  determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site and how
  they navigate throughout the Site. We will only use this information to
  improve The Oasis Site.

  <H3>Personal Information</H3> When registering at our Site as a Member, you
  may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information about
  yourself, such as your name, company name, job title, e-mail address and
  certain information about your business and preferences. You may also be
  given the option of providing additional personal information such as your
  URL, phone and fax number and mailing address.

<P>We use personal information provided by Members to notify Members about
  opportunities, deliver The Oasis newsletters and otherwise communicate with
  Members about The Oasis and its products and services. The Oasis will not
  share any personal information of Members with any unaffiliated third
  parties, without your consent.

<P>As part of your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining
  and updating, as applicable, your Member Account information with current,
  accurate and complete information. You may do this, using your password and
  user name, by visiting the customer service portion of The Oasis Site at
  http://www.the-oasis.net to make such changes.<BR>

  <H3>Cookies</H3> "Cookies" are pieces of information that are placed on an
  individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily
  communicate and interact with The Oasis Site. The Oasis may use cookies to
  customize your Site experience, to make sure you don't see the same ad
  repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your
  password (in some cases) so you don't have to re-enter it each time you
  visit our Site, and for other purposes. However, you may disallow cookies
  through your Web browser and still visit our Site. The Oasis will never use
  cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to The
  Oasis Site or Services or your interaction with The Oasis Site.

  <H3>Consent to Processing</H3> By providing any personal information to
  this Site, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection
  and processing of such information in the United States and/or any other
  country.

  <H3>Other Sites</H3> Our Site may contain links to other sites. Other sites
  may also reference or link to our Site. The Oasis is not responsible for
  the privacy practices or the content of such other sites.

  <H3>Supplemental Information</H3> We may supplement the information that
  you provide to us with information that is received from third parties.

  <H3>Security</H3> We take seriously the security for all personal and
  non-personal information associated with our visitors and participants.
  However, due to the open communication nature of the Internet, we can not
  guarantee that communications between you and The Oasis, and The Oasis and
  you, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.

  <H3>Choice/Opt-Out</H3> If we ever send you information by e-mail
  concerning new The Oasis products or services, we will provide you with an
  e-mail address by which you may request no future notices.

  <H3>Your Acceptance of this Policy</H3> By visiting this Site or receiving
  Services, you signify your assent to our then-current Privacy Policy. If
  you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Site or Services. We
  reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove
  portions from this policy at any time. Your continued use of our Site
  following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these
  changes.
